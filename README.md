This repository contains the resources and code for my paper titled "Enhanced Biomedical Relation Extraction through Ensemble Learning and Attention Mechanism".

## Abstract
Relation extraction (RE) plays a crucial role in biomedical research, as it is essential for uncovering complex semantic relationships between entities in textual data. Given the significance of RE in biomedical informatics and the increasing volume of literature, there is an urgent need for advanced computational models capable of accurately and efficiently extracting these relationships on a large scale. This paper proposes a novel approach combining ensemble learning Stacking and attention mechanisms to promote the effect of biomedical relation extraction. Through leveraging the advantages of multiple pre-trained models, our model demonstrates improved adaptability and robustness across diverse domains and application scenarios by ensemble learning Stacking. Additionally, introducing attention mechanisms enables the model to capture and utilize key information in the text more accurately. This study achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for three relation extraction tasks, providing new solutions for advancing biomedical informatics.
